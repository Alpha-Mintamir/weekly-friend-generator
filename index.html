<p>
    Welcome to this week's Weekly Friend Pairing! ðŸŒŸ We're trusting God to guide these pairings to deepen our friendships and foster growth in love. Stay connected with your friend through calls, texts, prayers, and spending time together, whether at church, a Bible study, or over a meal. Be intentional in supporting and uplifting each other, and at the end of the week, reflect on your time together, capture memories with a photo, and share your experience with the group. Letâ€™s make this week meaningful and full of love! ðŸ’›
